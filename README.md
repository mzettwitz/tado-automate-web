# Tado Automate Web ‚òïü§ñ

A minimal REST API for controlling Tado heating devices, designed for integration with automation apps like Automate on Android.  
This project allows you to turn heating on/off based on open window detection, with secure access via API key and HTTPS using Caddy and DuckDNS. 
For easier integration, a docker file is provided. Based on the [PyTado fork](https://github.com/wmalgadey/PyTado).  
All services in this project are free to use.

## üß∞ Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
* A DuckDNS domain (e.g., `yourdomain.duckdns.org`)
* Tado credentials
* Portforwarding in your router
* Ports in your docker host are available and not blocked by another application (e.g. pihole)
* [Automate](https://llamalab.com/automate/) installed on your Android phone


> Note, you do not need to use duckdns and expose your container at all. You can also use it in your local network only. 
Have a look at the section [Local Setup](#local-setup) for details.

---

## üõ† Installation
### Web Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mzettwitz/tado_automate_web.git
cd tado_automate_web
```

2. Set your environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  - API_KEY=yoursupersecretkey
  - TZ=Europe/Berlin

  - DUCKDNS_TOKEN=your_duckdns_token
```

3. Set your duckdns domain in `Caddyfile`: 

```json
yourdomain.duckdns.org {
```

> Note, you may want to adjust the rate limit for your needs. See [Caddy-Ratelimit](https://github.com/mholt/caddy-ratelimit)

4. Start and build the containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

> Note, on first startup, you need to register Tado. The login URL is shown in the container logs. 
Therefore, it ist best to start the containers attached without `-d` flag to have the logs in the console.

5. Ensure your router forwards ports (80 optional and) 443 to your host running Docker. You may want to forward a diffent external port to your Caddy local port. 
E.g. external 8765(web) to 443(docker host).


### Local Setup

Instead of exposing your server to the web, you can use the setup in your local network only. Hence, it will only work, when your phone is in the same network as the docker host. 
A VPN might be a solution for you if you want the same functionality when you are outside, but want to keep the server local.  
For the local setup, you just need to make minor changes:  
- docker-compose.yml: change expose to ports in the tado-container:
```yaml
api:
    build: .
    image: tado-automate-web-api
    container_name: tado-automate-web-api-container
    restart: unless-stopped
#   expose:
#     - "8000"
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

- docker-compose.yml: remove (or comment) all caddy parts: 
```yaml
# caddy:
#   build:
#     context: .
  ...

volumes:
#  caddy_data:
#  caddy_config:
```

- Port forwarding in your router is not necessary when serving local only
- Instead of calling the duckdns domain in your HTTP request, you need to call your local (docker host) ip

## ü§ñ Automate Integration

This section explains how to trigger the Tado API from the [Automate](https://llamalab.com/automate/) app on Android. Make sure you alter the nodes for your setup and language, see [Necessary Changes](#necessary-modifications-you-need-to-make)!  
Import the file `Tado Automate Web.flo` into Automate on your Android device and start the flow script. Make sure, you allow it to run in background (and energy safe mode).

### Mandatory modifications you need to make
You have to change the Automate script in two nodes:  
1. FX Expression check (3rd node): make sure the string "Open window" matches the language (and message!) of your tado app.  
2. HTTP request (4th node): update the input argument `Requst URL` to your domain (or local ip) and port (local network: docker port (e.g. 8000), web: router exposed port (e.g. 443 or 8765))
3. HTTP request (4th node): update the `Request headers` to your API key defined in the docker-compose.yml

### General Flow

1. **Trigger**

   * Event: `Notification received`
   * App: Tado
   * Store text in variable

2. **Expression Check: Open windows**

   * Expression: Tado notification variable contains "open window"
   * Text contains: "Window opened"` (or custom condition)
   * We do only check for this small part of the message since multiple windos can be open, and thus, the message changes

3. **Action: HTTP Request**

   * Type: `HTTP Request` ‚Üí `PUT`
   * URL: `https://yourdomain.duckdns.org/heater/off`
   * Optional: append `?zone=LivingRoom` to target a specific zone.
   * Headers:

     ```text
     X-API-KEY: supersecret
     ```
   * Timeout: 30 seconds
   * Follow redirects: No
   * Store response code and content in variable

4. **Expression Check: Response Handling**

   * HTTP response code is used to check if the request was successful:
   * If true: remove the Tado notification
   * If false: show a notification with the HTTP response content

## üî∑ API Endpoints

### Turn heater off

```http
PUT https://yourdomain.duckdns.org:8765/heater/off
Headers: X-API-KEY: supersecret
Optional query parameter: ?zone=LivingRoom
```

### Turn heater on

```http
PUT https://yourdomain.duckdns.org:8765/heater/on?zone=LivingRoom
Headers: X-API-KEY: supersecret
```

### List zones

```http
GET https://yourdomain.duckdns.org:8765/zones
Headers: X-API-KEY: supersecret
```

### Health check

```http
GET https://yourdomain.duckdns.org:8765/health
```

---

### Zone Detection

If no zone is provided in `/heater/off`, the API automatically detects the zone with `openWindowDetected`. 
Note, this will use additional Tado API calls. If you are a free user, this might interfere with your 100 API calls per day in case you have many(!) zones and call this function often. Usually, this should be no problem.

---

### Logging

All actions are logged in `/logs/l.log` inside the container if enabled in the docker-compose file.

---

## üí≠ Final Notes

* Always use HTTPS (`https://`) since Caddy provides a valid certificate without effort.
* Ensure the `X-API-KEY` header is included for authentication; otherwise requests will be rejected (HTTP 403).
* Rate limiting may block too many requests for protection. Adjust this if the limit is to strict for your needs.
